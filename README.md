## Installing

This theme is no longer being maintained. If any bugs present themselves that inherently affect your Steam experience, you can fix them, create a pull request and become a contributor/developer

## Building from source

The theme itself does not require anything being built, but to edit the theme you have to launch Steam with -dev mode.
This allows you to open the inspector on the Steam window, which allows you to edit CSS classes that you will forward to the theme

## Contributors
- [MapleAtMorning](https://github.com/MapleAtMorning) for maintaining the theme.
   
Contributing is encouraged. Anyone can create a pull request if it's deemed useful.
